    <h2>ðŸš¨ Most Common State crimes are comitted in</h2>

   <p> Traffic fines in Australia revealed information about a person's habits, age, and location. The most frequent infractions were obvious: using a cell phone while driving distracted drivers, failing to wear seat belts put lives at risk, speeding fines dominated the roads, and unlicensed driving slipped through the cracks.  


Young drivers, particularly those between the ages of 17 and 25, were at the top of the charts, and their carelessness or lack of experience cost them dearly. The 26â€“39 group, whose hectic schedules might have caused them to make hurried mistakes, followed closely behind.  

<p> States did not receive an equal share of the fines. Quieter areas like TAS and NT had fewer, while the busiest cities in *NSW* and *VIC* had the most. However, each state faced its own challenges.</p>  

<p> After analyzing these trends, authorities focused their enforcement and education efforts where they were most needed. Safer roads for everyone is the aim. The information was unambiguous.</p>
